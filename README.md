👋 Hi, I’m @mysticole928

- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and cybersecurity.
- 👀 I've been relatively disappointed in the self-paced tools I've found to learn both.
- ❤️ I wish Python (3) was around when I started in IT 30-odd years ago.
- 💻 I miss the vintage/retro computing environments of my youth but today's computing is much easier to manage.
